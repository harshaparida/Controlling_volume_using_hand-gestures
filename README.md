# Hand Gesture Control for Volume and Brightness

👋✨ This Python script allows you to control the volume and screen brightness using hand gestures captured from your webcam. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand detection and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- Control volume with hand gestures: Move your hand up or down to increase or decrease the volume respectively. 🔊

## Requirements

- Python 3.x 🐍
- OpenCV (cv2) 📷 (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy 🧮 (`pip install numpy`)
- MediaPipe 🖐️ (`pip install mediapipe`)
- PulseAudio control library (install using `pip install pulsectl`) 🔊

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Install the required libraries: 

## Usage

1. Run the `hand_gesture_control.py` script:
2. Ensure your webcam is correctly positioned to capture your hand gestures. 📹

3. Hold your hand in front of the webcam and make the appropriate gestures:
   - Use one hand to control volume by moving it up or down. 
   - Use another hand to control brightness by moving it closer or further from the camera.

4. Press `Esc` to exit the program. ⌨️

## Customization

- You can modify the code to adjust the sensitivity of hand gesture detection or customize the hand gestures used for volume and brightness control. 🛠️
